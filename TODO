Todo
01. Rewamp WKT reader/ writer interfaces - Done
    - Found a memory leak in wkt reader/writer. Will have to fix that. - Done
02. Implement GeoJson reader/writer
    -   Should be able to generate geometries from GeoJson.
03. Implement intersects - Done
04. Implement a feature to get number of points in a given geometry - Done
05. Write tests for Equals, EqualsExact, Covers, CoveredBy - Done


06. Wrap GEOS coords enums. So we will be able to use coords to build geometries.
07. Implement BufferWithOptions() method
08. There is high overload in calling c/c++ functions via CGO. So we have to write some wrapper functions which combines multiple geos functions into a single function.
09. Implement GetSRSByID()
